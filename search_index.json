["project-overview.html", "The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer Project Overview", " The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer 2017-02-23 Project Overview The Predictive Ecosystem Analyzer (PEcAn) is an integrated informatics toolbox for ecosystem modeling (Dietze et al. 2013, LeBauer et al. 2013). PEcAn consists of: An application program interface (API) that encapsulates an ecosystem model, providing a common interface, inputs, and output. Core utilities for handling and tracking model runs and the flows of information and uncertainties into and out of models and analyses An accessible web-based user interface and visualization tools An extensible collection of modules to handle specific types of analyses (sensitivity, uncertainty, ensemble), model-data syntheses (benchmarking, parameter data assimilation, state data assimilation), and data processing (model inputs and data constraints) This project is motivated by the fact that many of the most pressing questions about global change are limited by our ability to synthesize existing data and strategically prioritize the collection of new data. This project seeks to improve this ability by developing a framework for integrating multiple data sources in a sensible manner. The workflow system allows ecosystem modeling to be more reproducible, automated, and transparent in terms of operations applied to data, and thus ultimately more comprehensible to both peers and the public. It reduces the redundancy of effort among modeling groups, facilitate collaboration, and make models more accessible the rest of the research community. PEcAn is not itself an ecosystem model, and it can be used to with a variety of different ecosystem models; integrating a model involves writing a wrapper to convert inputs and outputs to and from the standards used by PEcAn. Currently, PEcAn supports multiple models listed [PEcAn Models].

["about-the-pecan-book.html", "1 About the PEcAn Book 1.1 How to Contribute 1.2 How this Book is organized", " 1 About the PEcAn Book This book serves as documentation for the PEcAn Project. It contains descriptions of topics necessary to inform a beginner and advanced user as well as requisite materials for developers. It does not contain low-level descriptions of functions within PEcAn. Our aim for this documentation is to educate you about the PEcAn software, the possibilities of its usage, and the standards,expectations, and core workflows for developers. 1.1 How to Contribute If you wish to contribute to this book, we greatly welcome it! The same general steps to contributing PEcAn code to the main line can be used to contribute to this book. 1.1.1 Editing the book yourself Navigate to the main PEcAn github repository: https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan and fork the repository to your github account. Use git clone on the machine your are using to create a local copy of the repository. General instructions can be found here Navigate to the book_source directory and edit the page you would like to change using any text editor. Save your files in the R markdown format (.Rmd). If you are adding a new page, you must edit the _bookdown.yml file also and list your page in order for it to be properly indexed by gitbook. Within the directory book_source diectory, execute make Use git add changedfile.Rmd to stage your changes and then commit git commit -m &quot;your message&quot; your changes and push (git push) them to your fork. Create a pull request, using github, with a description of the changes you have made. 1.1.2 Feedback/Comments/Suggestions We want your ideas, thoughts, comments, and suggestions! This is an open-sourced project so please feel free to reach out to us in the following ways: Github: https://github.com/PecanProject/pecan Serving as the main hub of communication surrounding PEcAn development, check out the issues section to see what is coming down the pipeline. If there is anything you feel you can contribute to, leave a comment. Gitter: http://pecanproject.github.io Gitter serves as our day to day mode of communication. Go to our homepage, linked above, and open the “OPEN CHAT” tab at the bottom to see what we are up to. All you need is a github account and you can chat with us about anything project related. Gitbook: https://pecan.gitbooks.io/pecan-documentation/content/ As stated above, this is a book with all of the documentation for the PEcAn Project. If you use the gitbook interface, next to each paragraph there is a “+” that will allow you to start a discussion. Please use this utility to ask for clarification about any documentation or direct any question/comment to the team. Email: pecanproj[at]gmail.com If you do not wish your communication with the team to be public, send us an email at the address above and we will get back to you as soon as possible. 1.2 How this Book is organized This book is organized into three main sections: A user section that is split three ways into a basic user’s guide, advanced web interface guide, and an advanced user guide for using pecan from the command line. A section dedicated to expaining the core modules contained within the PEcAn workflow. A developer section meant to serve as a guide to anyone interested in contributing to the project. "]
